= Motion Ipad Gallery

This is just a simple demonstartion of an ipad app utilizing a
UIPopoverController and compiled xib files.


There is currently some strange behaviour when run in the simulator. On first
build the bar button is unresponsiv, if you run rake again it seems to work.

It would be great if we could get to the bottom of this issue!
