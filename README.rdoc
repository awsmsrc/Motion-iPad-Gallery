= Motion Ipad Gallery

This is just a simple demonstration of an ipad app utilizing a
UIPopoverController and compiled xib files written with rubymotion.


There is currently some strange behaviour when run in the simulator. On first
build the bar button is unresponsive, if you run rake again it seems to work.

It would be great if we could get to the bottom of this issue!
